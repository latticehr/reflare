Build proxy piplines with <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a>
</p>

> This package is was originally based on a now-deleted project https://github.com/xiaoyang-sde/reflare. We've heavily modified the original code and removed some functionality.

**Reflare** is a lightweight and scalable reverse proxy library built for Cloudflare Workers. It sits in front of web servers (e.g. web application, storage platform, or RESTful API), forwards HTTP requests or WebSocket traffic from clients to upstream servers, and transforms requests and responses with several optimizations to improve page loading time.

## Installation

```bash
$ pnpm install @latticehr/reflare
```

```bash
$ bun install @latticehr/reflare
```

```bash
$ npm install --save @latticehr/reflare
```

```bash
$ yarn add @latticehr/reflare
```

## Usage

```typescript
import useReflare from "@latticehr/reflare";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const reflare = await useReflare();

    reflare.push({
      path: ["/api*", "/health"],
      upstream: {
        domain: "httpbin.org",
        protocol: "https",
      },
      onRequest: (request: Request) => request,
      onResponse: (response: Response) => response,
    });

    return reflare.handle(request);
  },
};
```

## Types

`Reflare` uses TypeScript for type-checking. Here are some of the key types used for configuring upstreams:

```ts
// Callback types for request and response manipulation
export type onResponseCallback = (response: Response, url: string) => Response;
export type onRequestCallback = (request: Request, url: string) => Request;

// Options for configuring upstream servers
export interface UpstreamOptions {
  domain: string;
  protocol?: "http" | "https";
  port?: number;
  onResponse?: onResponseCallback | onResponseCallback[];
  onRequest?: onRequestCallback | onRequestCallback[];
}
```

## Examples

#### Mirror [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

Set up a reverse proxy for MDN Web Docs:

```typescript
{
  path: '/*',
  upstream: {
    domain: 'developer.mozilla.org',
    protocol: 'https',
  },
}
```

#### S3 Bucket

Set up a reverse proxy for https://example.s3.amazonaws.com and add custom headers to the response:

```typescript
{
  path: '/*',
  upstream: {
    domain: 'example.s3.amazonaws.com',
    protocol: 'https',
  },
  onResponse: (response: Response) => {
    response.headers.set('x-response-header', 'Hello from Reflare');
    return response;
  },
}
```

`onRequest` and `onResponse` fields accept callback functions or an array of callback functions that can change the content of the request or response. For example, the following example replaces the URL of the request and sets the cache-control header of the response based on its URL. These fields accept either a standalone function or a list of functions. The function could be either async or non-async.

```typescript
reflare.push({
  path: "/*",
  upstream: {
    domain: "httpbin.org",
    protocol: "https",
    port: 443,

    onRequest: (request: Request, url: string): Request => {
      // Modifies the URL of the request
      return new Request(url.replace("/original/request/path", ""), request);
    },

    onResponse: (response: Response, url: string): Response => {
      // If the URL ends with `.html` or `/`, sets the `cache-control` header
      if (url.endsWith(".html") || url.endsWith("/")) {
        response.headers.set(
          "cache-control",
          "public, max-age=240, s-maxage=60"
        );
      }
      return response;
    },
  },
});
```
